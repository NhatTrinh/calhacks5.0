#INSPIRATION
Have you ever found yourself tossing away the old food that you bought 2 weeks ago and somehow did not use it until it went rotten? We have, too, and we understand how hurt it feels. As college students, we are aware of how valuable food is and that wasting food and money is not what we all want to do. Especially because food is one of the most essential but limited resources that every each of us needs.
Therefore, we created Walecumo! ("Waste Less, Eat More!") - a web application that can help you reduce food waste by showing you a variety of recipes using the ingredients you have in your fridge and also gives you access to many more awesome cooking recipes!
