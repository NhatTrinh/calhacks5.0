********************INSPIRATION********************
Have you ever found yourself tossing away the old food that you bought 2 weeks ago and somehow did not use it until it went rotten? We have, too, and we understand how hurt it feels. As college students, we are aware of how valuable food is and that wasting food and money is not what we all want to do. Especially when food is one of the most essential but limited resources that every each of us needs.
