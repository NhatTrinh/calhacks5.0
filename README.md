## INSPIRATION
Have you ever found yourself tossing away the old food that you bought 2 weeks ago and somehow did not use it until it went rotten? We have, too, and we understand how hurt it feels. As college students, we are aware of how valuable food is and that wasting food and money is not what we all want to do. Especially because food is one of the most essential but limited resources that every each of us needs.
Therefore, we created "Walecumo!" ("Waste Less, Cook More!") - a web application that can help you reduce food waste by showing you a variety of recipes using the ingredients you have in your fridge and also gives you access to many more awesome cooking recipes!
Moreover, "Walecumo!" is also a platform for qualified chefs that want to share their secret recipes/ingredients by selling their recipes to those who are interested. We added this feature by using the new technology called Blockchain to also promote Original Recipes Protection, which is meant for preventing plagiarism.

## HOW "WALECUMO!" WORKS
"Walecumo!" is built to highly encourage users to cook ingredients they already have and not waste them. The app promotes "Waste Less, Cook More!" by having users type in the ingredients and revealing a variety of recipes whose matching ingredients. This also helps users practice the habit of eating in more often than dining out and therefore prevents wasting food and saves money. 
In addition, "Walecumo!" lets users upload their own unique recipes, share, save and buy recipes. Other than that, only qualified chefs and restaurants can decide to sell their recipes or not. Recipes which are for sale are hidden from most users, except the owner, and can only be unlocked to those who pay the owner. This feature is built thanks to Blockchain Technology. Blockchain is known for it immutability, transparency, privacy and decentralization development.

## WHAT "WALECUMO!" IS BUILT WITH
Ethereum, Solidity, React, Python, Django, InterPlanetary File System.

## CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO
Figuring out how to use Solidity and Ethereum since this is the first time that we have ever integrated Blockchain in a project.

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
In the future, "Walecumo!" will have a mobile application version and it can scan barcodes, pictures for ingredients references.
